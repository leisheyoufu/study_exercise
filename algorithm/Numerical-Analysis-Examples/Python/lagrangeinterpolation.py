def lagrangeinterpolation(x, xp, yp):

    Example implementation of the Lagrange Polynomial Interpolation method.

    Args:
        x: float representing x value for which to calculate the interpolated y value

    Returns:
        float containing the interpolated y value

    Raises:
        ValueError: if the two input arrays are not the same length
