Problem F: Frequent values

You are given a sequence of n integers a1 , a2 , ... , an in non-decreasing order. In addition to that, you are given several queries consisting of indices i and j (1 ¡Ü i ¡Ü j ¡Ü n). For each query, determine the most frequent value among the integers ai , ... , aj.

Input Specification

The input consists of several test cases. Each test case starts with a line containing two integers n and q (1 ¡Ü n, q ¡Ü 100000). The next line contains n integers a1 , ... , an (-100000 ¡Ü ai ¡Ü 100000, for each i ¡Ê {1, ..., n}) separated by spaces. You can assume that for each i ¡Ê {1, ..., n-1}: ai ¡Ü ai+1. The following q lines contain one query each, consisting of two integers i and j (1 ¡Ü i ¡Ü j ¡Ü n), which indicate the boundary indices for the query.

The last test case is followed by a line containing a single 0.

Output Specification

For each query, print one line with one integer: The number of occurrences of the most frequent value within the given range.
