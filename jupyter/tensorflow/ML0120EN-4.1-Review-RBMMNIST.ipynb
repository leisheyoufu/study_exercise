    "#### How does it work?\n",
    "Simply, RBM takes the inputs and translates them to a set of numbers that represents them. Then, these numbers can be translated back to reconstruct the inputs. Through several forward and backward passes, the RBM will be trained, and a trained RBM can reveal which features are the most important ones when detecting patterns.   \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why are RBMs important?\n",
    "It can automatically extract __meaningful__ features from a given input.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What are the applications of RBM?\n",
    "RBM is useful for <a href='http://www.cs.utoronto.ca/~hinton/absps/netflixICML.pdf'>  Collaborative Filtering</a>, dimensionality reduction, classification, regression, feature learning, topic modeling and even __Deep Belief Networks__.\n",

    "#### Is RBM a generative model?\n",
    "RBM is a generative model. What is a generative model?\n",
    "\n",
    "First, lets see what is different betwee discriminative and generative model: \n",
    "\n",
    "__Discriminative:__Consider a classification problem in which we want to learn to distinguish between Sedan cars (y = 1) and SUV cars (y = 0), based on some features of an cars. Given a training set, an algorithm like logistic regression tries to find a straight line—that is, a decision boundary—that separates the suv and sedan. \n",
    "__Generative:__ looking at cars, we can build a model of what Sedan cars look like. Then, looking at SUVs, we can build a separate model of what SUV cars look like. Finally, to classify a new car, we\n",
    "can match the new car against the Sedan model, and match it against the SUV model, to see whether the new car looks more like the SUV or Sedan. \n",
    "\n",
    "Generative Models specify a probability distribution over a dataset of input vectors. we can do both supervise and unsupervise tasks with generative models:\n",
    "- In an unsupervised task, we try to form a model for P(x), where x is an input vector. \n",
    "- In the supervised task, we first form a model for P(x|y), where y is the label for x. For example, if y indicates whether an example is a SUV (0) or a Sedan (1), then p(x|y = 0) models the distribution of SUVs’ features, and p(x|y = 1) models the distribution of Sedans’ features. If we manage to find P(x|y) and P(y), then we can use `bayes rule` to estimate P(y|x), because: p(y|x) = p(x|y)p(y)/p(x)\n",

That is, the RBM can be viewed as a generative model that assigns a probability to each possible `binary state vectors` over its visible units (v). \n",

    "- The visible layer can have different binary states, or so called, configurations. For example, in the 7 unit visible layer (above photo), it has ${2^{7}}$ differnt configurations, and each configuration has its probablity (assuming we dont have any bias).\n",
    "    - (0,0,0,0,0,0,0) --> p(config1)=p(v1)=p(s1=0,s2=0, .., s7=0)\n",

    "\n",
    "RBM has two phases: 1) Forward Pass, and  2) Backward Pass or Reconstruction:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "__Phase 1) Forward pass:__  Processing happens in each node in the hidden layer. That is, input data from all visible nodes are being passed to all hidden nodes. This computation begins by making stochastic decisions about whether to transmit that input or not (i.e. to determine the state of each hidden layer). At the hidden layer's nodes, __X__ is multiplied by a __W__ and added to __h_bias__. The result of those two operations is fed into the sigmoid function, which produces the node’s output/state. As a result, one output is produced for each hidden node. So, for each row in the training set, __a tensor of probabilities__ is generated, which in our case it is of size [1x500], and totally 55000 vectors (_h0_=[55000x500]).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, we take the tensor of probabilities (as from a sigmoidal activation) and make samples from all the distributions, __h0__.

So, we can use __stochastic gradient descent__ to find the optimal weight and consequently minimize the objective function. When we derive, it give us 2 terms, called positive and negative gradient.

In this particular square, the gray color represents weight = 0, and the whiter it is, the more positive the weights are (closer to 1). Conversely, the darker pixels are, the more negative the weights. The positive pixels will increase the probability of activation in hidden units (after muliplying by input/visible pixels), and negative pixels will decrease the probability of a unit hidden to be 1 (activated). So, why is this important?  So we can see that this specific square (hidden unit) can detect a feature (e.g. a \"/\" shape) and if it exists in the input."
