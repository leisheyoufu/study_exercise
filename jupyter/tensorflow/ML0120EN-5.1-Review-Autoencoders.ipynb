    "An autoencoder, also known as autoassociator or Diabolo networks, is a artificial neural network employed to recreate the given input.\n",
    "It takes a set of **unlabeled** inputs, encodes them and then tries to extract the most valuable information from them.\n",
    "They are used for feature extraction, learning generative models of data, dimensionality reduction and can be used for compression. \n",
    "\n",
    "A 2006 paper named Reducing the Dimensionality of Data with Neural Networks, done by G. E. Hinton and R. R. Salakhutdinov, showed better results than years of refining other types of network, and was a breakthrough in the field of Neural Networks, a field that was \"stagnant\" for 10 years.\n",

    "Now, autoencoders, based on Restricted Boltzmann Machines, are employed in some of the largest deep learning applications. They are the building blocks of Deep Belief Networks (DBN).\n",
